You've got your makeshift team as well as a makeshift grid. What's next?

## Free Weapons and Characters

There are content called Side-Stories and upon completion, will reward you with free characters / weapons.
You may refer to the most notable one [here](https://gbf.wiki/Basic_Grids#Free_Completion_Rewards).

## Improve your grid

### Farmable Weapons

Weapons can be farmed from [raids](/guide/core-concepts-raids). At your current stage, you will want to farm Magna/Omega Weapons
as this is the F2P of GBF. You may follow [Basic Grids](https://gbf.wiki/Basic_Grids) wiki page as a goal.

### Unused Weapons / Summons

As you progress by replacing SR weapons with their SSR counterpart, you can reduce or reserve it.

You can learn more [here](/guide/core-concepts-reserve-reduce).

a really strong weapon throughout the game. Proto Bahamut also drops `Champion Merits` which will also be used a lot.

### Ultimate Bahamut (ExternalLinkIcon)
