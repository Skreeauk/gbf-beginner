## How to play this event?

The rewards are locked behind `Badges` and `Points` reward milestones.

We recommend to farm the `Extreme` difficulty as its quick and provides decent badges & points.

The `Proud` difficulty will be hard for newer players so you can just ignore it for now.
If you manage to clear it, you will get a trophy and 50 Crystal as the first time clear reward.
