## How to play this event?

You clear the `Extreme` quests and gain `Four Symbols Pendants` which can be used to buy things from a shop.
After hosting 8 `Extreme`s, a `Extreme+` will appear and you can gain a lot of `Four Symbols Pendants` if you are able to clear it.

For every `Extreme+` that spawns, a `ShenXian` boss will also appear.
This will also give a lot of `Four Symbols Pendants` when cleared.

## What to buy from shop?

-   Gold Nuggets
-   One copy for all of these:

    -   `Ray of Zhuque`, `Xuanwu Mace`, `Baihu Claw`, `Qinglong Spear` and `Qilin Bow`
    -   `Summer's Mirage`, `Winter's Frostnettle`, `Autumn's Transformation` and `Spring's Whisperings`
    -   `Garnet Broadaxe`,`Aquamarine Hatchet`, `Zircon Edge` and `Peridot Crossbow`
    -   `Zhuque Lyrewings`, `Xuanwu Shellfists` and `Baihu Fangstaff`
        is really niche and we recommend to get these on future reruns instead.

-   Seals
