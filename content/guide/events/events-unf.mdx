Unite & Fight (UnF / U&F) is also called Guild Wars (GW).
This event is the only competitive event in the game as it pits crews against each other.
If you know Princess Connect's Clan Battle, then this is similar but infinite attempts.

## Why play this event?

This event gives a lot of Crystals and Premium Draw Tickets.
This event is also the main source of Sunlight Stone and you can also farm characters
([Eternals](/guide/events-eternals)) that is still widely used until end-game.

## How to play this event?

This event is basically a Story/Boxing Event but with competitive aspects.
You farm host materials (commonly called meat) from Solo Battles or Extreme which is then used to host Nightmare Bosses.
