## How to play this event?

The rewards are locked behind `Nightmare / Unparalleled Foe` Quests and `Badges` and `Honor` reward milestones.

Doing any quests in this event may spawn a `Nightmare` Quest up to 2 a day.
These `Nightmare` Quests have varying levels and they grow stronger as the time passes.

Doing the higher level `Nightmare` Quest is recommended as these battles drop Crystals.
So keep in mind to always do them before reset.
