Eternals are farmable characters that can be really strong when fully upgraded.

## Obtaining Eternals

Obtaining an Eternal is a long process for a newbie but it gets easier as you get better at the game.

<Callout type="success">
    You can get a free Eternal by completing the side-story
    **Seeds of Redemption**. We recommend getting **Threo**
    as your first eternal.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
    If you obtain all 10 Eternals, you will get a permanent
    buff that gives 10% Initial Charge Bar to the whole
    party on any quest.

## Prioritization

Picking which Eternal to get might be a daunting choice,
however Eternals are still weak at 4* and requires 5* to at least be usable.

Uncapping Eternals to 5\* is also another lengthy grind
but just keep at it and you'll get there.

<Callout type="warning">
    Some Eternals at 5\* are just better than the rest and
    we recommend focusing on `Seox`, `Eahta` and `Niyon`.

## Transcendence

Transcend is uncapping the Eternal past beyond Lvl 100 up to Lvl 150.

It consists of 5 steps with each step increasing the Lvl cap by 10 and unlocking more bonuses.

<Callout type="warning">
    Some Eternals Transcended are just better than the rest
    and we recommend focusing on `Seox`, `Eahta` and
    `Niyon`.
