These events are old story events that is rerun with a different reward system.

## How to play this event?

This event is basically the same as side-story where you farm quests for materials which you can then buy items from a shop.

The only item prioritized to buy is Tickets and other limited items such as Perpetuity Ring.

We recommend that you do maniac and mission daily.

## Collab Events

Collab events are run in this format as well with additional items in the shop.

We recommend buying the Tickets and other limited items such as Collab Summons, etc.
