## How to play this event?

This event keeps track of 3 things, `Tokens / Drawbox`, `Badges` and `Honor`. Each having their own reward mileage.
You can gain these by simply beating the quests.

<Callout type="default">
	For around 2000 Tokens, you are able to empty 1 Drawbox
</Callout>

You want to play through the event story and then do the `Very Hard` Quest.
Farming this quest rewards you with a material which is used to host the `Extreme` and `Impossible` Quest.

You will want to host the `Impossible` Quest once to get the first clear reward and then farm the `Extreme` Quest.
Occasionally `Nightmare` Quest will pop up and you can do it to get more materials for free.

We recommend you to farm until you are able to get all the `Badges` and `Honor` rewards.
You also want to farm until you can empty Drawbox \#4.
You want to do this as Drawbox \#4 has a special reward such as SSR Draw Ticket, etc.

<Callout type="default">
	You can farm more until Drawbox \#20 as the Drawbox from
	1-20 gives Crystals. Going further is usually for more
	CP or other materials.
</Callout>
