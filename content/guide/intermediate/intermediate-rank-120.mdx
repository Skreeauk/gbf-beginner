## Dark Opus Weapons

These weapons are obtained through trading in `Shop > Treasure Trade > Weapons > Dark Opus Weapons`.

<Callout type="warning">
    Trading it early on will be expensive, so we recommend
    that you finish your M2 grids first before upgrading the
    Dark Opus Weapon.
</Callout>

These are vital as they have 3 weapon skills and allow players to customize 2 of the skills once it is upgraded.

The 2nd skill will be a Cap Up skill and you can choose between Normal Attacks, Skill, CA or CB.
Which one to choose depends on your team setup, if your setup CAs a lot, then the CA Cap / CB is the logical choice.

<Callout type="warning">
    This Cap Up does not stack with Ultima's Cap Up. So if
    there is a Ultima in the grid, make sure they have
    different Cap Ups.
</Callout>

The final uncap stage requires defeating a raid unlocked at Rank 170 and consumes a Gold Brick.
Don't avoid this as the upgrade is really strong.
