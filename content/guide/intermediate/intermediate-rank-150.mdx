This raid drops a `Gold Brick` in the Blue Chest.
You can trade materials from this raid for Holloysky Weapons.

### Hollowsky Weapons

These weapons are the first weapons to have supplemental skill in the game.
However they have annoying conditions attached and has become mostly obsolete

## Grand Order HL

This raid drops a `Gold Brick` in the Blue Chest.
Materials from this raid is used to further upgrade Cosmic Weapons

### Cosmic Weapons

<Callout type="default">
    Cosmic weapons are rarely used so no rush to farm it.
</Callout>

These weapons can actually be redeemed with Grand Order Normal materials,
however the weapon at that stage is not good enough to be mentioned.

Cosmic weapons are unique in that they boost the stats of other weapons in the grid,
making this weapon quite universal.

## Beelzebub

    advised to daily host this raid.
</Callout>

This raid is another **6 man** raid however unlike UBHL, does not drop significant rewards.
You can trade materials from this raid for Astral Weapons.

### Astral Weapons

These weapons have Unworldly EX skills and also provide Cap Up like Ultima / Dark Opus's 2nd Skill.
However the materials needed to redeem the weapons are too expensive for newer players such that we recommend
newer players to use Xeno Weapons instead.
