    It is highly advised to daily host this raid.
</Callout>

Ultimate Bahamut HL or UBHL for short will be the first **6 man** raid you encounter.
This make the raid way more difficult than the content you've done so far.

We recommend you to do this content with friends / crewmates / others early on
and do this daily as this raid drops `Gold Brick`.

Materials from this raid allows you to upgrade your Atma Weapon into an [Ultima Weapon](https://gbf.wiki/Ultima_Weapons).

### Ultima Weapons

These weapons have weapon skills that only boost characters with a specific weapon proficiency.
(E.g. Seox has a `Melee` proficiency, so only Ultima Claw will boost him)

    We recommend to not pay attention to this weapon at your current stage as it is not that good at 4* / FLB
