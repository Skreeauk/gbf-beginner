The grid becomes even more important as now you will need to farm raids
and aim for the [Blue Chests](/guide/core-concepts-impossible-raids#what-are-blue-chests).

## New Weapon Skills

Upon reaching Rank 120, the world opens up and so does your grid.
No longer are you stuck with weapons that only has Might skill.
Now there are various other skills that fits certain playstyles. Just to name a few:

|     Name     |                 Description                  |

## Playstyles

Playstyles can be divided into 3: `Normal Attack`, `Skill Spam` and `Charge Attack`.

### Normal Attack

Normal Attacks, also dubbed `Auto` or shortened into `NA`, is the damage dealt by characters by attacking normally.
This playstyle aims to use characters with a lot of [Bonus Damage (Echo)](), [Assassin]() and [Multi-Strike]().
The grid aims to have a lot of [General Supplemental]() and [Bonus Damage (Echo)]().

### Skill Spam

Skill spam focused team look for characters that are able to cast skills repeatedly either by having a low cooldown
or by activating automatically. The grid also wants as much [Skill Supplemental]() as possible.

### Charge Attack

CA focused teams will have characters that are able to build/provide charge bar consistently as well as big CA DMG.
Weapons with [CA Supplemental]() is preferred

    It is highly recommended to not force a certain
    playstyle on some elements as the result will be
    sub-par.
