## Things to consider

### Account Creation Date

The date you create your account is important for a special paid promotion, the Beginner's Draw Set offer.
Buying this promotion will give you the ability to choose 1 character that is available in the pool.
The pool will mirror the banner when the account is created.
For example, an account created during a Summer Banner can buy a Summer unit that is in the pool/banner at that time.

### Account Birth Date

Due to Japanese law, accounts with birth dates under the age of 20 have a monthly in-app purchase limit of 10,000 JPY.
If you plan on spending more than 10,000 JPY per month, make sure you enter a birth date of at least 20 years.
You cannot change your birth date once you submit it.

### "Guest" Accounts

If you start an account through the mobile app (Android or iOS), you have an option to play as a "guest" account (officially called a "Mobage basic account")
which lets you skip the registration process and instead associate your account to your device.

If you do not connect a mobage account or social media account (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) to your Granblue account,
you risk permanently losing your Granblue account if you factory reset, lose your device, or uninstall the game app.
You also cannot log into your Granblue account through the browser or other devices until a mobage account or social media account is connected.

### Connecting an account to Yahoo! Japan or Apple ID

Buying Granblue Coins with a Yahoo! Japan account requires a Japanese mobile phone number or address.
There is no other option to buy in-game coins, so connecting an account to Yahoo! is not recommended.

Apple ID is an option to log into the game, but since Apple IDs have an associated region attached to it,
buying Granblue Coins may be difficult unless the ID already has its region set to Japan.

Creating a registered Mobage account for Granblue generally has the least known issues and has multiple payment options available.

### IP Account Registration Limit

If you receive an error after entering in your email address (will say リクエストパラメータに誤りがあります),
your IP may have been temporarily blocked from creating new accounts.
This will **ALWAYS** happen after creating 10 accounts from the exact same IP address within a single daily reset period.
The block only seems to take place on the page where you enter your email address,
so it's possible to enable a proxy, enter an email and click confirm,
and then disable the proxy and continue the registration/rolling process.
