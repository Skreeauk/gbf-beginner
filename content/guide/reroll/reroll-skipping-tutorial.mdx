We recommend to play through the tutorial at least once. This is to teach you of some basic controls.

## Skipping

1. When the introduction video starts, you will notice the URL in your address bar ends in **#tutorial/3**.
1. Increment the number at the end of the URL bar by 1, so it ends in **#tutorial/4**, and press Enter to advance to the next step in the tutorial.
    - Repeat this process 1 by 1 until **#tutorial/6**. You need to let the scene load, then click Skip to the lower left.
1. At **#tutorial/9**, change the URL directly to **#tutorial/12**.
1. Press Skip on **#tutorial/12** to go to **#tutorial/14**.
    - (Do not try going to **#tutorial/13**.)
1. From here, skip directly to **#tutorial/32**.
1. This will bring you to the Link screen. Do not try to link an account here. Press Cancel to return to the title screen, then click Start and the game will automatically load you at **#tutorial/30**. (It is not possible to skip directly to #tutorial/30 through URL manipulation.)
1. Click Skip in the lower left twice, then you will be (properly) taken to the Link screen. See step #5 in [Account Creation](/guide/reroll-account-creation).
