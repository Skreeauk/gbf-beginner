## Where and How?

-   All new accounts receive one free Premium 10-Part Draw a day for a week. Click the Draw button on your home page and scroll down until you see the free 10-pull button.
    -   This first Draw is rigged to always give you 1 SSR and 9 R/SR.
    -   The SSR will be from a very reduced pool
    -   Free Draws on subsequent days are regular Premium 10-Part Draws.
-   After linking your account with a login service, you will be allowed to do 100 free rolls on a 6% SSR banner with the same characters available as the most recent Premium or Flash Gala banner by using New Skyfarer Step Up Special available on the gacha page.
-   When you reach the Home screen for the first time, you will be first taken through the Login Rewards. The first login reward is a Premium Draw Ticket.
-   From the Home Page, click the arrow on the right side of the screen to visit the Town area. Click each gold sparkle on the map to receive some items.
    -   After all 4 sparkles turn silver, refresh the page, then visit the sparkles again in this order: top, left, right, middle. This gets you an extra Premium Draw Ticket.
-   Completing the "Upgrade a Character" Pinboard Mission rewards a Max Level Ticket. Just feed a weapon to a character to complete the mission.
-   On the Home Page, press the Top/News button in the top left to be taken to the title screen. Scroll down on this page until you see a button labeled Serial Codes. Click that banner and enter the following two serial codes for JDA Magazine tickets:
    > j5pamkru2vcx4cr8 <br />
    > yrwgyv8mcck2wcbf
    > {" "}
-   Return to the Home screen, then click the present box icon (your Crate) in the middle of the page. Accept all of the draw tickets.
-   Click the Menu button again and click Draw.
-   On this Draw screen, you will see a scrolling banner listing detailed information about featured characters, a section showing examples of what is contained in the draw pool, a section for the Premium 10-Part Draw, and lastly, a section for (single) Premium Draw.
-   In the Premium Draw (Single) section, use both of your Premium Draw Tickets.
-   When you draw, the color of the crystal tells what you're about to roll:
    -   Blue: Rare (R), the lowest rarity you can get from Premium Draw. Can be either a weapon or a summon. Summons are pictured inside crystals. Standard rate is 82%.
    -   Blue (with rainbow tip): Rare character weapon. The weapon you get here will come with an R character.
    -   Amber: SR or better. It is still possible to get an SSR from this crystal if the shard that flies out is rainbow. Standard rate is 15%.
    -   Rainbow: SSR guaranteed. Standard rate is 3%, but doubles to 6% during Galas.
    -   For any shard, if the background turns to night, that means it's a character weapon.
-   To roll the JDA Magazine and Max Level tickets, click the Ticket/Other tab on the top right of the Draw page. There will be a section for ticket rolls at the bottom.
