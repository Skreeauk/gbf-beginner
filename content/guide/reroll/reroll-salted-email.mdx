We recommend using Gmail accounts as they allow salts which allows you to use the same e-mail multiple times for registration.

This tutorial assumes you are using a Chromium-based browser and is using Incognito Mode as well

## Salted Emails

To use a salted e-mail, you add a <span className="text-red-600">**+string**</span> between the name and the @gmail portion of your e-mail address.

For example, if your Gmail account name is name@gmail.com, a salted e-mail would be name<span className="text-red-600">**+1**</span>@gmail.com, or
name<span className="text-red-600">**+text**</span>@gmail.com, and so forth. The string behind the + symbol can be any letters or numbers of any length,
but, to easily keep track of rerolled accounts, we recommend using numbers.

Any e-mails sent to a salted e-mail will be redirected to the email without the salt used, so in the previous example,
any mail sent to any version of the email address would all be sent to name@gmail.com.

    Mobage sends a lot of e-mail spam, so you may want to
    avoid using a primary e-mail address for your Granblue
    Fantasy account. You can unsubscribe from emails, but it
    requires logging into Mobage from a mobile device (or
    forcing your browser to emulate a mobile device via
    Developer's Tools). [See this for
