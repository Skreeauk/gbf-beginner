Understanding the damage formula will take you far in terms of building teams and grids.

## Simplified Formula

<Callout type="default">
    Damage = ATK x Total Boost

    Total Boost = Omega x Normal x EX x Elemental

</Callout>

## Breaking down the Simplified Formula

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + (Total Omega Weapon Skills ATK% x Total Omega Aura) + Unboosted Omega

    Total Omega Aura = 100% + Omega Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Normal = 100% + (Total Normal Weapon Skills ATK% x Total Normal Aura) + Unboosted Normal

    Total Normal Aura = 100% + Normal Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    EX = 100% + (Total EX Weapon Skills ATK% x Total EX Aura) + Unboosted EX

    Total EX Aura = 100% + EX Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Elemental = 100% + Elemental Advantage + Elemental Aura

    Elemental Advantage = 50% when Superior | -25% when Weak | 0% for others

</Callout>

## Estimated DMG

GBF provides an Estimated DMG calculator below the grid.

1. Press the (i) icon
2. Select the Support Summon you want
3. It will calculate your dmg including the current party's main aura as well as the support summon

## Example

For example, we will ignore Elemental and Summons and you have a grid full of Magna Weapon giving 20% Omega each. You would have

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + 200% = 300%

    DMG = ATK x 300% x 100% x 100% = 300% x ATK

</Callout>

But if you change one for a Normal Weapon that gives 20% Normal.

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + 180% = 280%

    DMG = ATK x 280% x 120% x 100% = 336% x ATK

</Callout>

Now lets factor in a 3\* / MLB Omega Summon (100% Boost)

<Callout type="default">
    Total Omega Aura = 100% + 100% = 200%

    Omega = 100% + 200% x 200% = 500%

    DMG = ATK x 500% x 100% x 100% = 500% x ATK

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Total Omega Aura = 100% + 100% = 200%

    Omega = 100% + 180% x 200% = 460%

    DMG = ATK x 460% x 120% x 100% = 552% x ATK
