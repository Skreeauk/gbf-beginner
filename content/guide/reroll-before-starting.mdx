As like other gacha games, there will be times where GBF have an event with a much more appealing banner to pull on. Rerolling during these banners will significantly increase your chances of getting what you want / something valuable.

## What Banners should I plan for?
- [Flash](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Flash_Gala)
- [Legend / Premium](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Premium_Gala)
- [Seasonal (Valentine / Summer / Halloween / Christmas)](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Seasonal)
