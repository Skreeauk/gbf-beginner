As like other gacha games, there will be times where GBF have an event with a much more appealing banner to pull on. Rerolling during these banners will significantly increase your chances of getting what you want / something valuable.

## What Banners should I plan for?
- [Flash](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Flash_Gala)
- [Legend / Premium](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Premium_Gala)
- [Seasonal (Valentine / Summer / Halloween / Christmas)](https://gbf.wiki/Draw#Seasonal)


## When should I reroll?

These Events / Banners usually comes with free rolls, lots of freebies and special paid promotions (Except Flash & Legend / Premium)

- Anniversary Event (March) !
- Christmas / New Year Event (Dec - Jan) !
- Seasonal / Celebration Events
    - Valentine (Feb) !
    - Summer (Mar & Jul-Aug) !
    - Halloween (Oct) !
- Legend & Flash, special bi-monthly banners that feature 6% SSR Draw Rates

There are also certain dates where a Legend / Flash banner can combine with another special banner (e.g Summer Flash / Legend) resulting in a Summer Banner with 6% SSR Draw Rate.
