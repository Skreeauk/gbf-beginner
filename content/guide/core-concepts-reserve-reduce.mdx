Reserving is the act of destroying Weapons to get Weapon XP and skill points.

Reducing is the act of destroying Weapons to get materials such as weapon stones.

## Which Weapon to reserve?

As a beginner, you will be lacking a lot in terms of Weapon XP and skill points.
So you want to be as efficient as possible to maximize your resources.

In general, all R weapons, Skill Shard and Skill Jewel should be reserved.
R weapons are useless and the Skill Shard/Jewel is made to be reserved.

You may start reserving **FARMABLE SR & SSR** weapons after you're done with your grid.
If you're done with SR weapons, then go ahead and reserve all the farmable SR weapons.

## Which Weapon to reduce?

Only SR & SSR Weapons can be reduced however it is different between Farmable and Gacha Weapons.

|    Weapon    | Weapon Stone |
| :----------: | :----------: |
| Farmable SR  |      1       |
|   Gacha SR   |      10      |
| Farmable SSR |      20      |
|  Gacha SSR   |     200      |

It is recommended to reduce Gacha Weapons if needed but farming SSR weapons is also good.
If you had to reduce a Gacha Weapon, please consult with others first.
