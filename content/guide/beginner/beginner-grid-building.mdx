The heart of your team. If the grid fails, then the team 99% will fail too.

## Understanding the grid

The grid has 10 weapon slots. 1 of them is for Main Hand and the rest completes the grid.

The Main Hand is important as it adds flexibility or complexity as well to the team.
This is achieved through its Charge Attack (CA).
A weapon might have a healing CA which can allow you to use a more offensive oriented class.

    Some content allow you to have 13 weapon slots, however
    it is way beyond your reach right now

## Which weapons to slot

You want to slot in weapons that boost the team's element attack. This can be Might / Stamina / Enmity.
Focusing on dealing damage is the best way to progress the game as the game demands farming a lot
and more damage means faster farming time.

## Auto Select Button

We **insist** that you stay away from pressing the auto button. Upon pressing it, your whole team (characters, weapons, summons)
will be replaced with what the game think is best for you. Unfortunately the game's best is 100% different.

The game's auto will only pick characters, weapons and summons with the highest stats possible,
ignoring any weapon skills in the process. This is very bad.
