To progress anywhere in GBF, you always need a team. A team for farming, soloing, etc.

Every character have their ups and downs, and a well-balanced team will make your life easier.

## Team Element

In GBF, your teams are 99% always mono-element (same elements).
Weapons 90% of the time only boost 1 element, and this is how you deal good damage.

You can learn more about weapons [here](/guide/core-concepts-weapon-skills)

<Callout type="default">
	There are weapons that can boost multiple elements
	however it is way beyond your reach right now.
</Callout>

## Main Character

The MC (Gran / Djeeta) is irreplaceable and their main use is to complement the team.

MC is able to change classes to complete the team.
For example, your team might be lacking in healing and MC can change into a class that has healing.

We advice newer players to unlock Dark Fencer & Lumberjack

You can learn more about classes [here](/guide/core-concepts-classes)

## Character Rarity

Most usable GBF characters are SSRs but as a new player,
you will use SR characters to fill up the slot for the time being.

<Callout type="success">
	If you're playing during freebies / free rolls, it is
	very likely you don't have to use any SR characters.
</Callout>

## Selecting Characters

You might have the luxury of having more than 5 SSR characters for a certain element.

You may consult [Gamewith Tier List](https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List) only when you're completely new.

<Callout type="danger">
	The tier list **does not** fully reflect the state of
	the game. It is only useful for beginners to form a
	makeshift team.
</Callout>

If you're still confused as you don't have any characters thats high on the tier list,
you can just use anything for the time being as you're still new and the game is easy.
