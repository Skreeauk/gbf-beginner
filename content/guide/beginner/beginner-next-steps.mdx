You've got your makeshift team as well as a makeshift grid. What's next?

## Free Weapons and Characters

There are content called Side-Stories and upon completion, will reward you with free characters / weapons.
You may refer to the most notable one [here](https://gbf.wiki/Basic_Grids#Free_Completion_Rewards).

## Farm Events

Events rewards a ton of resources and it is recommended to get the rewards until a certain point.

### Story / Boxing Events

You get rewards from this type of event by farming a event material which is used to farm an Event Token.
The Event Token is then traded in to empty boxes.

We recommend to at least empty 4 boxes as it can give a SSR Ticket.

### Rerun / Shop Events

You get rewards from this type of event by farming event materials which then can be used to trade items in a shop-like manner.

We recommend to at least empty out Tickets and CP if its available.

## Improve your grid

### Farmable Weapons

Weapons can be farmed from [raids](/guide/core-concepts-raids). At your current stage, you will want to farm Magna/Omega Weapons
as this is the F2P of GBF.

### Unused Weapons / Summons

As you progress by replacing SR weapons with their SSR counterpart, you can reduce or reserve it.

### Grid Goals

We recommend following [Basic Grids](https://gbf.wiki/Basic_Grids) wiki page as a goal.

<Callout type="success">
    The next few pages lists the content that you can do at
    that rank, as well as what you should aim for.

    Please take a look if you get lost.
