## Whats in Intermediate

These will be touched upon again on the Intermediate Section

### Magna 2 (Regalia)

<Callout type="default">
    These raids are unlocked at **Rank 120**. These raids
    should not be leeched as their weapons only drop from
    Blue Chests.

Another Magna squad appears before you to upgrade your grid.
