This guide will be teaching you on how to progress and be optimal as much as possible as a new player

The game does not teach the mechanics of the game well enough and reading from wiki / google docs is annoying

This guide is built to make the learning curve easier or at least improve readability compared
to [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hP9uCQi6-6-hsu_f6f5P_jb2urP3Hr7zTn6_fHeu24k/view)
or [Wiki](https://gbf.wiki/Rerolling) (among many, many others).

## Phases of Progression

Due to how big the game is, it will be divided into these parts:

-   Beginner (Rank 1 - 120)
-   Intermediate (Rank 120 - 170)
-   Advanced (Rank 170+)

This guide will touch on _Beginner_ and _Intermediate_.
This guide will not expand on _Advanced_ at all. For now.
