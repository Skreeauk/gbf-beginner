This guide will be teaching you on how to progress as a new player.

The game does not teach the mechanics of the game well enough and
reading from wiki can make you get lost while google docs can be annoying.

This guide is built to make the learning curve easier and
provide newer players with info on what they should be doing for progression.

## Phases of Progression

Due to how big the game is, it will be divided into these parts:

-   Beginner (Rank 1 - 120)
-   Intermediate (Rank 120 - 170)
-   Advanced (Rank 170+)

This guide will touch on _Beginner_ and _Intermediate_.
This guide will not expand on _Advanced_ at all. For now.
