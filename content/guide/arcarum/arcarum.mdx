After obtaining and upgrading the Arcarum Summons, you will gain access to [Evokers](/guide/arcarum-evokers).

## How to play this?

To play this game mode, you will need `Arcarum Badges` which is given once daily.

You will be greeted with 3 Paths: `Point Aquila`, `Point Bellator` and `Point Celsus`.
Each of the path will have 9 expedition with each expedition having 3 sections as well. (e.g 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2-1 up to 9-3)

1 `Arcarum Badge` allows you to do 1 expedition.
Each section will have a mission which you will need to complete to move on to the next section.

## Which path to choose?

You will choose all 3 paths to get the Arcarum Summons, so the question becomes which Arcarum Summon to focus.

## Arcarum Summons

There are a total of 10 Arcarum Summons and each will require a `Sun Stone`.
The Arcarum Summons can be split into 2 categories, the DMG Summon and HP Summon.

DMG Summons are Arcarum Summons that boost DMG, and HP Summons are Arcarum Summons that boost HP.

<Callout type="warning">
	We highly recommend to focus on getting the DMG Summons first, which are
	`The Sun`, `The Moon`, `The Hanged Man`, `Judgement`, `The Star` and
	`Death`.
