Evokers are farmable characters from Arcarum.

## Obtaining Evokers

To recruit an Arcarum Evoker,
the player must first fully forge the Arcarum Summon of the respective character to 5★.

## Prioritization

Since we recommend to not upgrade Arcarum HP summons, we can narrow it down to 6 characters.

<Callout type="warning">
    Some Evokers are just better than the rest and we
    recommend focusing on `Caim`, `Nier` and `Katzelia`.

## New World Foundation Weapon

New World Foundation (NWF) Weapons are unlocked once the related evoker is recruited.

The weapon uses `Astras` and `Ideans` to uncap.

## Domain of the Evoker

Evoker Domains are like special EMPs limited to Evokers.
Instead of needing XP to raise EMP, it consumes materials to unlock the domain.

Evoker Domains has 4 steps with each step increasing the material needed to unlock the next step.
Additionally, the 2nd - 4th steps requires the related NWF to be uncapped.

Once all 4 steps are unlocked, the Domain is activated and the Evoker gains a new passive.

## Uncapping Evoker

Uncapping an Evoker requires:

-   Raise to level 80.
-   Unlock all their Domain bonuses.
-   Obtain and uncap their related New World Foundation Weapon to 5★.
-   Complete the Fate Episode that unlocks after obtaining the above.
