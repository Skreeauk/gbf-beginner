## Should I play this?

This game mode aims to speedup your arcarum progress further
as this can be farmed without `Arcarum Badges` and uses an energy named `AAP`.
AAP can be refilled with pots, so just assume its the usual stuff.
New weapon series also drop here called Militis Weapons.

<Callout type="default">
    We highly recommend newer players to not focus on this
    mode as to efficiently farm this mode, it requires
    decent grids and characters.
</Callout>

## How to play this?

We recommend to clear missions which will give you bonuses through guidebooks.
Having the correct bonuses will improve you farming experience by a lot.

<Callout type="default">
	Guidebooks are sets of buffs that you can pick for a fight in sandbox. The
	buffs are locked behind missions, so we recommend you to focus on some big
	impact guidebooks.

    Here Be Staves: `Valor's Guidebooks`, `Avarice's Guidebook`, `Adept's Guidebook` <br />
    Here Be Swords: `Overflow's Guidebook`, `Demolition's Guidebook` <br />
    Zone Mundus: `Specialist`, `Shockwave`, `Thunderclap`

After getting the relevant bonuses, then you farm the `5 bar mobs` continuously for ideans and astras.
Occasionally killing heralds to get boosts and extra xp/rp.
Chests may spawn and it may be a mimic, defeat the mimic to obtain loot and 200 AAP.

## Enemies

### Mobs

Each mob in a zone have a defender gauge which can have `3 Arrows` or `5 Arrows`.
We commonly call it `3 bar mob` or `5 bar mob`.

When the defender gauge is full, then it will spawn a Defender.

### Defender

A Defender is a relatively strong mob and after you defeat it,
it will come back stronger which is denoted by a `+` sign on the name (e.g Defender+).

### Heralds

Heralds are mobs that sometimes appear after defeating any enemy in the zone.
Defeating them gives a buff which boosts sephira gauge.

### Treasure Chest

Treasure chests can appear after defeating any enemy.
Opening the chest may give random loot or spawn a mimic.
Killing the mimic will reward you with random loot and 200 AAP.

### Zone Bosses

Zone bosses requires material from Defenders to host and they also get stronger after you kill it.
The 1st encounter (weaker) has a `P-TYPE` on the image.

### Xeno Bosses

Xeno boss can be unlocked by clearing the respective Zone Boss once.
This will be another source of Evolite or Gold Brick.
