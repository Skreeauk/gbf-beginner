We recommend players to reroll as there are items that can only be obtained through draws and nowhere else. And usually these items are just so strong and will make your life way easier

## Is it Necessary?

Rerolling is not necessary, you can still play the game just fine. Especially if you're a PNG collector, then at most you just reroll for that PNG.

## How long is each reroll?

Each reroll should take around 10 - 15 minutes
