description: Some extra stats won't hurt
---

For each MC Class, you are able to customize further with Extended Mastery Perks (EMP).

These are bonus stats that can be unlocked for the MC and sometimes for the whole party.

<Callout type="warning">
    EMPs are shared between classes. Gaining EMP on one class does not restrict where you spend it.

    On the other hand, Unlocked EMPs are not shared between classes
    (eg. buying the ATK perk on Fighter will not affect ATK on Berserker)

</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
    Keep your EMPs until Row III and IV. We recommend to
    invest on Row III as little as possible.
</Callout>

## Which EMP to take?

We highly recommend taking the ATK and HP EMPs whenever possible.

<Callout type="success">
    At Rank 155, 185, 210 , a HP EMP for the whole party is
    unlocked. We highly recommend taking these too.
</Callout>
