Understanding the damage formula will take you far in terms of building teams and grids.

## Simplified Formula

<Callout type="default">
    Damage = ATK x Total Boost

    Total Boost = Omega x Normal x EX x Elemental

</Callout>

## Breaking down the Simplified Formula

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + (Total Omega Weapon Skills ATK% x Total Omega Aura) + Unboosted Omega

    Total Omega Aura = 100% + Omega Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Normal = 100% + (Total Normal Weapon Skills ATK% x Total Normal Aura) + Unboosted Normal

    Total Normal Aura = 100% + Normal Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    EX = 100% + (Total EX Weapon Skills ATK% x Total EX Aura) + Unboosted EX

    Total EX Aura = 100% + EX Aura from Character/Weapon/Summons

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Elemental = 100% + Elemental Advantage + Elemental Aura

    Elemental Advantage = 50% when Superior | -25% when Weak | 0% for others

</Callout>
