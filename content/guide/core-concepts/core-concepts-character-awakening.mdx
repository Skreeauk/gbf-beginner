Character Awakening is an option of providing more stats to a
character once a character is already max level.

There are 4 types of Awakening: `Balanced`, `Attack`, `Defense` and `MultiAttack`.
The default Awakening is `Balanced` and to switch to another Awakening will require items.

## Which Awakening to take?

Its all subjective to the character's playstyle.
(E.g. A strong auto attacker would want `MultiAttack`)

When in doubt, just stay as `Balanced`.
