For example, we will ignore Elemental and Summons and you have a grid full of Magna Weapon giving 20% Omega each. You would have

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + 200% = 300%

    DMG = ATK x 300% x 100% x 100% = 300% x ATK

</Callout>

But if you change one for a Normal Weapon that gives 20% Normal.

<Callout type="default">
    Omega = 100% + 180% = 280%

    DMG = ATK x 280% x 120% x 100% = 336% x ATK

</Callout>

Now lets factor in a 3\* / MLB Omega Summon (100% Boost)

<Callout type="default">
    Total Omega Aura = 100% + 100% = 200%

    Omega = 100% + 200% x 200% = 500%

    DMG = ATK x 500% x 100% x 100% = 500% x ATK

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
    Total Omega Aura = 100% + 100% = 200%

    Omega = 100% + 180% x 200% = 460%

    DMG = ATK x 460% x 120% x 100% = 552% x ATK

</Callout>
