Weapon Skills are modifiers that give bonuses of a stat to characters that meet the
criteria (e.g. `Boost to Dark Allies ATK` will only affect Dark Characters)

<Callout type="default">
    There are other criterias such as Character Race,
    Character Weapon Proficiency, etc
</Callout>

## Deconstructing Weapon Skills

Weapon Skills can be split into three, `effect`, `lvl` and `type`.

The skill effect is the `Big Boost to Allies ATK` and this has a % value.
The skill lvl determines the numerical value of effect like a skill lvl 1 could have 1% while a skill lvl 10 could have 10%.

The skill type comes into play to differentiate between `Omega`, `Normal` and `EX`.
Each type will have different ranges. See the table below detailing `Medium HP Boost to Allies` to understand what we meant.

|  Type  | Skill Lvl 1 | Skill Lvl 10 | Skill lvl 15 | Skill Lvl 20 |
| :----: | :---------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Omega  |    6.0%     |    15.0%     |    17.0%     |    20.0%     |
| Normal |    6.0%     |    15.0%     |    17.0%     |      -       |
|   EX   |    3.0%     |    12.0%     |    14.5%     |      -       |

## Understanding Weapon Skill Types

`Omega`, `Normal` and `EX` is not just used to differentiate the ranges,
but also in deciding on which summons to use as if you're using a Magna Summon,
then you will want to have more Omega Weapon Skills in the grid.

## Upgrading Weapon Skills Lvl

You can raise a weapon's skill lvl by using another weapon with a skill (does not have to be the same weapon or skill).
