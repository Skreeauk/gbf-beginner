description: The true measure of a man is how he sets up his summons.
---

To start any quest, you need to pick a support summon.
So having a good a support lineup will make others want to add you too.

## Which Support Summons

It is highly recommended to put Magna Summons as your support summons in each respective element slots.
The misc slot is usually reserved for Qilin & Huanglong.

## Why are the supports placed like this?

The placement of the Support Summons are encouraged to be the same
as others to minimize mouse movement and for consistency.

Imagine you want to farm a certain quest/raid repeatedly however suddenly in the first slot,
its not your desired support anymore. Now your setup may fail and you wasted time and pots/berries.

Generally, the top slot (Slot 1) is for Primal Summons if you have them uncapped.
If not it is Magna Summons or Elemental Summons that are 140%+.

The bottom slot (Slot 2) for people with Primal Summons are Magna Summons,
while Magna Summons will leave the Slot 2 empty.

<Callout type="warning">
    Specifically for Water Slot 2, it is usually reserved
    for Drop Rate Summons (Rabbit, Nobiyo, Kaguya)
</Callout>
