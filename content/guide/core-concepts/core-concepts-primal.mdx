Primal Summons are gacha summons that boosts weapon skills that Magna Summons doesn't boost, primarily Gacha Weapons.

We insist that you build a Magna Grid before even thinking about Primal Grids as
all content in the game is doable as Magna and just because you can doesn't mean you have to.

## Why Primal

Primal Summons have the advantage over Magna Summons in terms of pure number as Primal Summons provide 150% boost
while Magna Summons are 140%. Combined with the fact that most weapons that are boosted by Primals are stronger
than Magna Weapons and that 10-20% gap becomes noticeable.

## How to obtain

Primal Summons are obtainable from Gacha and paid promotions such as Surprise Ticket, Star Premium Draw, etc.

## When to transition into Primal

Primal Grids requires a lot of Grand Weapons to have a huge lead over Magna else the difference is not that noticeable.
We highly recommend you to stick with Magna while stockpiling on Grand Weapons.
