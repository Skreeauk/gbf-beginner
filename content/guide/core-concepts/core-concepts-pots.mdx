To host anything, you will need Full / Half Elixirs.
We won't tell you how to use your pots but we will recommend you things to do to restock it back.

## Event

-   Rerun / Shop Events provides some Half Pots
-   Story / Boxing Events rewards pots in the boxes.
    We recommend to do 20 boxing as these boxes contain pots and crystals.
    -   At least do 4 boxes as it usually has a SSR tix on the 4th Box.
    -   Box 21+ does not provide anymore crystals.

## Side Stories

Side Stories are really similar to Rerun / Shop Events, so do the same thing.

## Campaign Exclusive Quest (CEQ)

CEQ is available during Magfest and it is a pot-positive special quest,
allowing you to level up units as well as stock up on pots.
