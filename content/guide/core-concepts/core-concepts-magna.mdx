Magna Summons are summons that boost weapon skills with the
Omega symbol and is the de-facto F2P of GBF

We insist that you build a Magna Grid before even thinking about Primal Grids as
all content in the game is doable as Magna and just because you can doesn't mean you have to.

## How to obtain

These summons drop from their respective raids, you want to uncap the SSR version to 3\* ASAP **before Rank 120**
and upgrade them to the next stage whenever possible after **Rank 120**.
