Raids are a big part of GBF and this page will try to explain
to you some raid mechanics that may help your progress.

## Raid Drops

Raids drop chests or also called reward chests,
drops after the raid is killed and each chest have its own loot that it can roll for.
The important part of these chests is that some are not guaranteed.

For example, Tiamat Omega Extreme Raid has 4 non-guaranteed chests.
Obviously while you are farming this raid for its weapon or summon,
you want as much loot as possible.

This is where `Boost to Drop Rate` comes in.
Some summons such as Rabbit / Nobiyo / Kaguya has this as an aura.

MC is also able to boost drop rate by using the `Bounty Hunter` skill
from the Thief / Raider / Hawkeye / Bandit Tycoon class.

    You can refer to a raid's chest drops in their
    respective page in the wiki. Here is [Tiamat
    Omega](https://gbf.wiki/Tiamat_(Raid)#Extreme)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    A common misunderstanding, `Boost to Drop Rate` only
    increases the chance of the chest dropping. It does not
    affect the chances of the loot inside the chest.

## Leeching

In general, leeching low level raids are not frowned upon.
So if you want to get more weapon drop,
start to use Rabbit / Nobiyo / Kaguya or use the `Bounty Hunter` skill to increase your drop rate.

At some point, leeching will not get what you want, so you can leech now.

## MVP / Vice-MVP

People that MVP or Vice-MVP a raid will receive an extra chest.
The MVP will receive the MVP chest while the Vice-MVP will have a chance to
receive a MVP chest or a random chest that is not the Host / MVP.
