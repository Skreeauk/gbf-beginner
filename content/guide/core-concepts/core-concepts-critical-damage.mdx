Some elements are able to utilize Critical Damage and we will try to explain the mechanics behind it

## Understanding Critical DMG Stacking

Critical Hit Rate can come from various sources: `Character / Summon Buffs`, `Grid Weapon Skills` and `EMP`.

Think of each source as a dice and everytime a character deals damage,
it will roll the dices 1 by 1.

<Callout>
    Imagine we have a Crit (Buff) as well as Crit (Grid) and Crit (EMP).

    If we roll Buff and Grid but fail EMP, our Final DMG would be DMG x Crit (Buff) x Crit (Grid).

    If we roll Buff and EMP but fail Grid, it will be DMG x Crit (Buff) x Crit (EMP).

## Critical DMG (Grid)

Weapon Skills that give Critical is actually only Critical Hit Rate.
The Critical Damage from Grid is always a static value of 50%.
