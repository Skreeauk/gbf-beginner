Classes allows MC to be flexible and certain classes are too good compared to others.

## Which classes are good?

We highly recommend you to unlock **Dark Fencer** ASAP as it gives you the skill `Miserable Mist`
which lowers enemies ATK and DEF by 25%, a good skill until end game.

<Callout type="default">
    To unlock Dark Fencer, you will need to lvl up Knight,
    Priest, Enhancer -> Sentinel & Arcana Dueler
</Callout>

Relic Buster is also easily obtained as the requirements are from trading materials only.
The class is also really strong and provides both defensive and offensive capabilities to the team. A really solid class.

## How to obtain CP

You can gain CP from ranking up but it is only 30 CP per rank.

We recommend clearing Side Stories as they have 400 CP and Events as much as you can.
Side Stories also have Premium Draw Tickets, so you can do it in one place.

## Row IV & EX-II

As you progress through the game, you will eventually unlock Row IV & EX-II classes.

We recommend unlocking **Chaos Ruler, Lumberjack, Chrysaor & Lumberjack** for Row IV.
While **Kengo** is the best option for EX-II.

### Unlocking Row IV & EX-II

To unlock Row IV & EX-II, you will need to:

1. Upgrade their Replica Weapon
2. Upgrade the Replica Weapon into a Class Champion Weapon (CCW)
3. Upgrade the CCW into the 2nd stage (Rebirth)
4. Upgrade the Rebirth CCW into an "Element-Changed" CCW

<Callout type="danger">
    Stop here if you only want to unlock Row IV or a
    specific EX-II. Going further requires **Rank 120** and
    makes the weapon exclusive for the respective Row IV /
    EX-II
</Callout>

5. Upgrade into the final form

<Callout type="warning">
    The Kengo class **MUST** use the final form of its CCW,
    so we recommend people to redeem Murakumo Replica and upgrade it into Unsigned Kaneshige

    Kengo is a really good class but that also means you would have to repeat this process
    multiple times to craft various elements of Unsigned Kaneshige. But just take your time.
