These character EMPs works the same way as MC EMPs,
just that its only for themselves.

Each character has a base limit of 18 EMPs.
The limit can be extended through Permanent Mastery or Uncapped Mastery.

## Which EMP to take?

As a general rule of thumb,
any EMP that has Cap UP such as Skill Cap Up or CA Dmg Cap Up is prioritized.

Any other EMPs are subject to each character's playstyle.

## Over Mastery

You are able to consume rings to give characters bonus stats.
Which bonuses to keep is subject to the playstyle.

## Permanent Mastery

This is like a marriage system in GBF,
but instead of unlocking new voice lines or CGs,
it provides stats and increases the EMP limit by 10.

This can be done by consuming a Perpetuity Ring.

<Callout type="warning">
    There are only limited amounts of Perpetuity Ring in the
    game. We suggest only using this if you really like
    character.

## Aetherial Mastery

This mastery provides further stats although there aren't a lot of choices.

This can be done by consuming an earring of that character's element.

to a maximum of 10 EMP increase.
