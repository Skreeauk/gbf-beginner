HL / Impossible Raids appears once you reach rank 101 and it will expand further as you rank up even more.

These raids drop Prestige Pendants which will be crucial for your progress.
These raids also introduce a new mechanic called `Blue Chests`.

## What are Blue Chests?

Blue chests are a special chest that drops depending on your contribution in the raid.
n general, the more damage you do in the raid, the higher your contribution.

These blue chests usually contains what you want from the raid and this is why its
important to have a functional team & grid before tackling HL raids as you **REALLY** want those blue chests.

Especially [Magna 2 (Regalia)](https://gbf.wiki/Impossible_Omega_II_Raids),
the weapons that you want from this raid is only in the Blue Chest, Host or MVP.
