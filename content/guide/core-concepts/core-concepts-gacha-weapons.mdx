As the name implies, it can only be obtained through gacha and it is further classified into 2-3 part.
`Premium Weapons`, `Grand Weapons`, `Seasonal Weapons`. Officially there are no `Seasonal Weapons`
however we include it here to make it easier to understand.

## Premium Weapons

These weapons are mostly useless however there are cases where its really strong.
Generally people keep them around until they get dupes and uncap it slowly.

Once its uncapped to the fullest, it might be usable depending on the weapon skill.

For beginners, just keep them around and don't use them

## Grand Weapons

Grand Weapons are from characters that can only be obtained when there is a Gala Banner.
These weapons are really strong and makes up most of a Primal Grid.

These weapons have the `Grand` text on their weapon icon to differentiate them from the rest.

<Callout type="warning">
    It is highly recommended to only spark during Gala
    Banners to stockpile on Grand Weapons as well as the
    higher SSR rate on Gala Banners
</Callout>

## Seasonal Weapons

This is basically just Premium Weapons however it comes from Seasonal Characters instead.
Same reasoning can be applied here where some of the weapons are really strong.
However due to the nature of being a seasonal, it can make a grid/setup to be more expensive.
